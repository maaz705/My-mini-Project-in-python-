## Rock, Paper, Scissor Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissor" game in Python.
It allows the user to play against the computer, where both the user and the computer make their choices,
and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game:

Rock smashes Scissor.
Scissor cuts Paper.
Paper covers Rock.
If both the user and the computer choose the same item, the game ends in a tie. This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, user input handling, and random choice generation. It is an excellent example for beginners to understand the fundamentals of programming and game logic.

The game is straightforward yet entertaining, providing a fun way to practice basic Python programming.
It highlights the use of if-else conditions, user input processing, and the random module to generate the computer's move.
This project is a great starting point for those new to programming,
offering a hands-on approach to learning how to build simple interactive applications.
