## Monthly collge and flat rent divider:


The provided Python code calculates the monthly expenses for a group of people living together in a hostel or flat.
It prompts the user to input various expenses, including rent, food costs, electricity consumption, charge per unit,
and the number of people sharing the living space.
The code then calculates the total bill and the amount each person should contribute to the monthly expenses.
Finally, it prints the calculated output with two decimal places.
This code can be useful in various scenarios where a group of people need to share expenses,
such as roommates or students living in hostels.

The code begins by using the input() function to get user input for each expense category.
These values are then converted to integers using the int() function to ensure they are treated as numerical values for calculations.
The total_bill variable is calculated by multiplying the electricity consumption by the charge per unit,
giving the total cost of electricity for the month. The output variable is calculated by dividing the sum of food expenses,
rent, and total bill by the number of people sharing the living space, determining the amount each person should contribute to the monthly expenses.
Finally, the print() function is used to display the calculated output value with two decimal places,
providing a clear and formatted representation of the amount each person needs to pay.

This code can be adapted to include other expenses, such as internet costs or cleaning supplies,
to provide a more comprehensive breakdown of living costs. It can also be modified to handle different scenarios,
such as situations where expenses are shared unequally based on factors like room size or usage. Overall,
this code provides a valuable tool for individuals living in shared accommodations to fairly divide their expenses and maintain
a harmonious living environment.
